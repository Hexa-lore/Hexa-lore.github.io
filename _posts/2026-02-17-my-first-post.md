This is my first post. I am a girl filled with numerous ideas.
Just like many others I am an ambitious dreamer but I must say.
As ambitious as I am, I lack in the execution department.

I believe that I'm still too young to say that life is tiring.
But there a lot of things happening in this world right now that makes
your dreams 1000x hard to reach.

When I was young let's say teenage. I was optimistic, later on I realized that 
optimism isn't always about smiling in the face of adversity.

Anyway, I can say that I've changed over the course of time.
I had more discipline back then.
Now, I don't know it feels like I'm a newborn baby again.
Trying to figure the ways of life.
