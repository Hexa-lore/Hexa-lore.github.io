A valentine well spent.

It is said that February is the month of love. But, I believe that all year round is about love. Different kinds of love that is shown in different ways.
It has been three years since I started dating a wonderful person that I won't drop the name. We've spent a lot of quality time and getting to know each other.
For context both of us are software engineers. Which is why we kinda have a funny way of showing our appreciation and effort.

Last year He made me a mini game to ask me out on valentines day. It was so fun and I really loved it.
This year He made a matrix. As you'll see in the video below.
